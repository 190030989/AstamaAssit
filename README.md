Problem Statement/Opportunity*: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an individual’s or a group’s perceived physical and mental health over time.

Project Description*: The standard 4-item set of Healthy Days core questions (CDC HRQOL– 4) has been in the State-based Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) since 1993 (see BRFSS website). From 2000 to 2012, the CDC HRQOL– 4 has been in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for persons aged 12 and older. Since 2003, the CDC HRQOL– 4 has been in the Medicare Health Outcome Survey (HOS)—a measure in the National Commission for Quality Assurance’s (NCQA) Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS). Standard Activity Limitation and Healthy Days Symptoms modules have also been available since January 1995. When used together, these measures comprise the full CDC HRQOL–14 Measure. See the Health Related Quality of Life Measures in Spanish.
